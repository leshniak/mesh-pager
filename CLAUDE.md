## Build & Upload

```bash
pio run                                            # build
pio run -t upload --upload-port <PORT>              # flash
pio test -e native                                 # run host-side unit tests
```

**Upload port** — ask the user for the port if not already specified in the conversation. Never auto-detect.

## Hardware Quirks

- **ESP32-C6 USB-JTAG**: the serial port disappears when the device enters deep sleep (15s inactivity). To re-flash: press the physical button to wake, then immediately upload. If that fails, hold BOOT + press RESET to enter download mode.
- **Serial monitor doesn't work reliably** over USB-JTAG on this board. Use on-screen debug (toast messages) instead of serial logging when debugging.
- **Deep sleep kills USB** — expect upload failures. Just retry after waking the device. This is normal, not a bug.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered structure with clear separation:

```
config/   — compile-time constants (pins, radio params, UI layout, colors)
protocol/ — Meshtastic-compatible packet encoding, AES-256-CTR encryption, protobuf codec
hal/      — hardware abstraction: RadioHal (SX1262 via RadioLib), TouchInput, Display, Buzzer, PowerManager
app/      — application logic: state machine (AppState), CannedMessages (NVS persistence)
ui/       — rendering: Renderer (LGFX_Sprite double-buffer), ToastManager (history ring buffer)
main.cpp  — glue: setup, loop, event routing, state transitions
```

## Key Conventions

- **All UI constants in `UIConfig.h`** — colors (RGB565), dimensions, timing. No magic numbers in rendering code.
- **All app constants in `AppConfig.h`** — timeouts, tone frequencies, mesh flags.
- **Dirty-flag rendering** — only redraw when `dirty = true`. Set it whenever visible state changes.
- **No LGFX clipping** — the display library has no clip rect support. Use plain rects, not rounded rects (rounded corners were tried and abandoned).
- **RGB565 color format** — use the `rgb565(r, g, b)` constexpr helper in UIConfig.h.
- **Namespace structure**: `mesh::config`, `mesh::protocol`, `mesh::hal`, `mesh::app`, `mesh::ui`.
- **State machine** in `AppState.cpp` is pure (no side effects) — it takes `InputEvents` and returns the next `State`. Side effects happen in `main.cpp` switch cases.
- **Stay-awake lock** — double-click toggles standby mode. Screen turns off after normal timeout but radio stays active. Only valid text messages on our channel (same filtering as toast) or BtnA wake the screen. Emergency deep sleep with tone after `kStayAwakeMaxMs` (10 min). Red dot in status bar near battery.
- **RX keeps device awake** — incoming messages reset the sleep timer.
- **Packet deduplication** — `PacketDedup` (64 entries, 10 min expiry) filters duplicate packets received via multiple relay paths.
- **No display dimming** — Nesso N1 backlight is IO-expander GPIO (on/off only, not PWM). `setBrightness()` has no effect.

## Display

- 135x240 pixels, portrait orientation, 16-bit color
- Single `LGFX_Sprite` double-buffered to internal SRAM (no PSRAM on ESP32-C6)
- Layout top-to-bottom: status bar (18px) → toast (if active) → message card (fills rest)
- Status bar: node ID (left), stay-awake dot (if active), battery icon + percentage (right)
- Message card: hint text → channel name → centered message → page dots → hold progress bar

## Touch Gestures

Handled by `TouchInput` which produces `TouchEvent` with a `TouchGesture` enum:
- `SwipeLeft` / `SwipeRight` — navigate messages
- `SwipeDown` / `SwipeUp` — toggle history overlay
- `HoldTick` / `HoldComplete` — hold-to-send with progress (1000ms)
- `Wake` — first touch after display sleep

Swipe detection compares `absDx` vs `absDy` against `kSwipeThresholdPx` (20px).

## Meshtastic Protocol

Custom implementation (not the official Meshtastic library):
- **Packet format**: 16-byte mesh header + AES-256-CTR encrypted protobuf payload
- **Encryption**: mbedtls AES-256-CTR, nonce = packetId(8) + sourceNode(4) + pad(4)
- **Channel hash**: XOR of channel name bytes XOR key bytes
- **Broadcast only**: dest = `0xFFFFFFFF`. ACKs don't work for broadcast (Meshtastic limitation).
- **PortNum 1** = TextMessage. Other port numbers are received but silently ignored.

## Secrets

`include/secrets.h` contains channel name, base64 key, and canned message array. Never commit it. See `secrets.example.h` for the template.

## Versioning

Uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Tag releases on the master branch.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Format specifiers on RISC-V**: `uint32_t` is `unsigned int`, not `unsigned long`. Use `%u` or cast to `unsigned`, not `%lu`.
- **Broadcast ACK**: Meshtastic nodes don't ACK broadcast messages. `kWantAck` is off for this reason.
- **Send-on-wake** (`kSendOnWake`): disabled by default. Uses `esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause()` to distinguish deep sleep wake from cold boot.
- **Upload retry**: if the port is "busy", something else has it open (screen, serial monitor). Kill it first.
